## From chaos to version control


Do you find yourself drowning in a sea of document versions like doc_v1.txt, doc_v2.txt, doc_v3_rev2_final.txt, doc_v3_rev2_def_FINALFINAL.txt? Are you afraid of ruining or losing an excellent version of your document? Would you like to keep track of all your document versions without getting tangled in a chaotic mess of files?

Version control systems allow you to effortlessly track changes and have the security that you can always roll back to previous versions of your documents and code.

## Version control with `git`

`git` is a widely-used version control system. 


### Curiosities

From [`git` repository](https://github.com/git/git):

> The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your mood):

> * random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.

> * stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.

> * "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.

> * "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks



Greg Wilson (co-founder of Software Carpentry*) said ([Perkel, 2018, _Nature index_](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/when-it-comes-to-reproducible-science-git-is-code-for-success)):

> "I hate Git. It is one of the worst pieces of software to teach that I've come across in 35 years of teaching software."

But, he adds:

> "...mastering Git is as essential to modern research as learning to read English. Those who use Git and have become immune to its complexity, he jokes, suffer from Git-induced Stockholm Syndrome"
