Do you find yourself drowning in a sea of document versions like doc_v1.txt, doc_v2.txt, doc_v3_rev2_final.txt, doc_v3_rev2_def_FINALFINAL.txt? Are you afraid of ruining or losing an excellent version of your document? Would you like to keep track of all your document versions without getting tangled in a chaotic mess of files?

Version control systems allow you to effortlessly track changes and have the security that you can always roll back to previous versions of your documents and code. 

## Aim

This workshop will introduce:
- `git` - the widely-used version control system 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - the online repository that allows you to access your code from anywhere, publish your project and easily work with others.

## Prerequisites
Don't worry if you don't have prior programming experience, this workshop will guide you step by step. 

This a workshop in git and GitHub built with [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs).
